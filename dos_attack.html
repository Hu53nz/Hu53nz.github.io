            <h2>What is a DoS Attack?</h2>  
            <p>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with a flood of illegitimate requests.</p>  
            <h3>Examples of DoS Attacks</h3>  
            <ul>  
                <li><strong>HTTP Flooding:</strong> Overwhelming the server with HTTP requests.</li>  
                <li><strong>UDP Amplification:</strong> Exploiting open servers to amplify traffic.</li>  
                <li><strong>Slowloris Attack:</strong> Keeping multiple connections open to exhaust resources.</li>  
            </ul>  
            <h3>Solutions to Prevent DoS Attacks</h3>  
            <ul>  
                <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Limit the number of requests a user can make.</li>  
                <li><strong>CAPTCHA:</strong> Verify users with CAPTCHAs during high traffic.</li>  
                <li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> Distribute traffic across multiple servers.</li>  
                <li><strong>WAF:</strong> Use Web Application Firewalls to block malicious traffic.</li>  
            </ul>

            <h2>DoS Attacks on Chatbots</h2>  
            <p>Chatbots are increasingly becoming targets for DoS attacks due to their growing presence in customer service and other applications. A DoS attack on a chatbot can overwhelm the underlying server, causing it to become unresponsive and thereby disrupting service for legitimate users.</p>  
  
            <h3>Code Implementation for DoS Protection in Chatbots</h3>  
            <p>The following code demonstrates how to implement rate limiting, IP blocking, and DoS protection for a chatbot using the Streamlit library in Python. You can access the code <a href="sample_chatbot_code.py" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  
  
            <h3>How the Code Works</h3>  
            <p>The code integrates several measures to protect a chatbot from DoS attacks:</p>  
            <ul>  
                <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> This limits the number of requests a user can make within a certain period. The code sets a rate limit of 5 requests per minute. If a user exceeds this limit, they receive a warning. If they continue to exceed the limit, they get temporarily blocked for 5 minutes. After multiple violations, the user can be permanently blocked.</li>
