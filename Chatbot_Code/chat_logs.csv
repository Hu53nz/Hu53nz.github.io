You: what is wine made of?
Bot: Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. The grapes are harvested, crushed, and the juice is extracted. The juice is then fermented with yeast, which converts the sugars in the grape juice into alcohol. The fermentation process can take several weeks to several months, depending on the type of wine being produced. During fermentation, the grape juice turns into wine and the solid parts of the grapes, such as the seeds and skins, are separated out. The resulting wine can vary greatly in taste, color, and texture depending on the type of grapes used, the fermentation process, and the aging method."
